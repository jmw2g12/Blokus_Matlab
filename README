Matlab

This directory includes various functions used when generating the neural
network and its Java counterpart.

Run the script called net_from_startup once there exists training data
in the Data Processing directory. See the README there for more details.

Once an adequate network is created call get_net_weights_biases passing the net
as an argument, then call output_java_net using the result. This will save it
into a file, you can add it to the Java Application folder to be used in either
the PolicyNetPlayer or the MCTSPlayer with policy network simulation weighting.
